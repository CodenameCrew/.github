# Welcome to Codename Crew!
_Codename Crew_ is a team made of the people behind the creation of _Codename Engine_, an engine for the game [Friday Night Funkin'](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin).<br>
Our team aims to optimize the original experience of FNF while also supporting its community with providing the necessary modification methods enclosed in a single engine program.

## Background
This group and its project were originally founded by [Yoshman29](https://github.com/YoshiCrafter29) and it was supposed to be a continuation of the older FNF Engine [Yoshi Engine](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/YoshiCrafterEngine), although after a while Yosh chose to abandon the modding community and focus on other matters, leaving the project's future to us.

## Documentation / Source
Everything about this project is open source and documented in our [website](https://codename-engine.com/) and also on GitHub, where [Codename Engine's source](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/CodenameEngine) also is.<br>
**NOTE:** While we always end up being open source, we test our biggest updates in a closed source repository before publishing them into the public one.

## Owners / Contacts
Codename Crew currently has 5 owners: [Nex_isDumb](https://github.com/NexIsDumb), [Ne_Eo](https://github.com/NeeEoo), [Lunarcleint](https://github.com/lunarcleint), [WizardMantis](https://github.com/WizardMantis441), [Frakits](https://github.com/Frakits).<br>
